# SON-Algorithm

This assignment focuses on implementing SON-algorithm to find frequent itemsets on a real-world dataset. For this assignment, we use Apache Spark framework to develop a program to find frequent itemsets in two datasets, one simulated dataset and one real-world dataset generated from Yelp dataset.

We are implementing SON algorithm to solve the tasks specified in the Assignment PDF. 

Task 1 we are using a Limited-Pass Algorithms to find how efficently they can work on the simulated dataset and compare it with SON-Algorithm on said dataset.

Task 2 works on extracting relevant data from YELP dataset using Preprocess.py and using the extracted data to form basis for the SON-Algorithm.

A detailed reference to the assignment is provided in Assignment PDF.
